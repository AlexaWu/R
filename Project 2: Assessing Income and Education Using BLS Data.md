## Project Contents

*1. Data Manipulation in R*
  - Based on [Dataset1.xml](https://github.com/AlexaWu/R-project---Econometrics-Theory-and-Applications/blob/master/tables/Dataset1.xlsx) - notice that some observations involve top-coded income (where any income >= $300,000 is shown as exactly $300,000)
  - Remove those observations and reattach data

*2. Hypothesis Testing in R*
  - Test the null hypothesis that in 2012 the average income of BLS79 responders equaled $40,000
  - Test the null hypothesis that in 2012 the average income of BLS79 responders equaled $45,000
  - Test the null hypothesis that in 2012 the average income of BLS79 responders equaled $50,000
  - Create a worksheet “Hypothesis Testing” in the Excel spreadsheet including the following for each of the above tests:
    - Calculated value of t
    - P-value
    - 99% Confidence interva

*3. Single Variable Regression Analysis in R*
  - Run OLS with one Regressor on Income: Incomei =	Bo + B1(Educationi) + ui
  ![]()
    - Using homoskedasticity-only standard errors

*4. Basic Linear: Multiple Variable Regression in R*


*5. Various Functional Forms: Multiple Variable Regression in R*
