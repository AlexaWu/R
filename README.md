# R Project: Econometrics Theory and Applications

- Utilized R programming skills to run statistical calculations on supplied data sets.
- Applied econometric methods involving panel and time series data.
- Critiqued reported regression results in applied academic papers, and interpret the results to a variety of audiences.

> This is a project from Master’s level course in Econometrics. Econometrics is applying	statistical tools and techniques to	study	economic issues	and	theory. This course will focus on **econometric methods involving panel and time series data**, with applications relevant for both economics and finance.
